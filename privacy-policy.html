    <h1>Privacy Policy for FlyTie</h1>
    <p>Last updated: September 10, 2025</p>
    <p>At FlyTie, accessible at <a href="https://learntrend.github.io">https://learntrend.github.io</a>, one of our main priorities is the privacy of our visitors. This Privacy Policy document outlines the types of information that are collected and recorded by FlyTie and how we use it. This policy applies only to our online activities and is valid for visitors to our website with regard to the information they share and/or we collect.</p>
    
    <h2>1. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h2>
    <p>We are a Data Controller of your information. FlyTie’s legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described in this Privacy Policy depends on the personal information we collect and the specific context in which we collect it. We may process your personal data because:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You have given us permission to do so (e.g., through cookie consent).</li>
      <li>Processing is necessary to provide our services (e.g., storing comments or likes).</li>
      <li>It is in our legitimate interests to improve our services (e.g., analytics).</li>
      <li>We need to comply with legal obligations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the following types of information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Personal Data:</strong> When you submit comments or replies, you voluntarily provide a username and comment content. This information is stored and displayed publicly on the website.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We use Google Analytics 4 (GA4) to collect anonymized data about your interactions with the website, such as page views, time spent, and events (e.g., liking a phrase, submitting a comment, completing a quiz, or sharing a streak). This data may include your IP address, browser type, device information, and approximate location (e.g., country).</li>
      <li><strong>Local Storage Data:</strong> We store certain information in your browser’s local storage, such as liked phrases, bookmarked phrases, streak counts, and cookie consent preferences. This data is not sent to our servers unless explicitly shared (e.g., comments).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Collect Information</h2>
    <p>We collect information through:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>User Input:</strong> When you enter a username and comment or reply in our comment section.</li>
      <li><strong>Cookies and Tracking Technologies:</strong> We use cookies via Google Analytics 4 to track usage data, but only if you provide consent through our cookie consent popup.</li>
      <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> We store preferences and interaction data (e.g., liked phrases, streaks) in your browser’s local storage for functionality purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide and maintain our website’s functionality (e.g., displaying comments, tracking streaks).</li>
      <li>Improve our services by analyzing anonymized usage data through Google Analytics 4.</li>
      <li>Allow user interaction, such as liking phrases, submitting comments, and sharing results.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
    <p>We use cookies for analytics purposes via Google Analytics 4. You can accept or decline these cookies through our cookie consent popup. If you decline, we will not collect analytics data, but essential functionality (e.g., comments, streaks) will still work, as it relies on local storage rather than cookies.</p>

    <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We share limited data with the following third parties:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google Analytics 4:</strong> We use GA4 to collect anonymized usage data. Google may process this data according to its own <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Google Apps Script:</strong> We use Google Apps Script to store and retrieve comments and likes. This data is stored securely and only accessible to authorized personnel.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal data as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Comments and Likes:</strong> Stored indefinitely on our servers (via Google Apps Script) unless you request deletion.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics Data:</strong> Retained by Google Analytics 4 for up to 14 months, depending on their retention settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Local Storage Data:</strong> Stored in your browser until you clear your browser data or local storage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
    <p>Under GDPR, you have the following rights regarding your personal data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Access:</strong> Request access to the personal data we hold about you.</li>
      <li><strong>Rectification:</strong> Request correction of inaccurate data.</li>
      <li><strong>Erasure:</strong> Request deletion of your personal data (e.g., comments).</li>
      <li><strong>Restriction:</strong> Request restriction of processing your data.</li>
      <li><strong>Objection:</strong> Object to processing for specific purposes (e.g., analytics).</li>
      <li><strong>Data Portability:</strong> Request a copy of your data in a structured format.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise these rights, contact us at vaada2023@gmail.com. We will respond within 30 days.</p>

    <h2>9. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your data, including secure storage of comments via Google Apps Script and anonymization of analytics data. However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>10. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>FlyTie is hosted on GitHub Pages, and comments are stored via Google Apps Script, both of which may involve data transfers to servers outside the EU (e.g., in the United States). We rely on Google’s GDPR-compliant data processing agreements to ensure adequate protection for EU users’ data.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated “Last updated” date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>

    <h2>12. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at vaada2023@gmail.com.</p>
